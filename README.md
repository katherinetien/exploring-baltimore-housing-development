# Identifying Data Trends in Housing and Community Development Data of Baltimore, MD. 
## Background Information
Baltimore has seen a steady decline in population in recent years, and numbers continue to drop as residents relocate due to high crime rates (which increased dramatically after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015), lack of economic opportunity, and inadequate education system.
